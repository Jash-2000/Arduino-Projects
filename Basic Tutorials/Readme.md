This directory contains all the basic programes that can be used while learning basics of Arduino. 
Apart from my tutorials, I would refer everyone to refer Jeremy Blum's Book Titled [Exploring Arduino: Techniques in Engineering Wizardry](https://www.amazon.in/Exploring-Arduino-Techniques-Engineering-Wizardry/dp/1118549368#:~:text=Learn%20to%20easily%20build%20gadgets,%2C%20and%20human%2Dcomputer%20interaction.)

A neat and well defined solution for the book's assignents have been provided in this directory itself. A link to the tinkerCad wiring diagram for each of these sketches have also been provided with each sketch.
