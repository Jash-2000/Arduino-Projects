## Description of each sketch.

  * Clap - This sketch contains a simple application wherein the user can control all the home applicances by making clapping patterns. This project can also be extended to an IoT project and the code base for it is contained in the **IoT subdirectory** inside the clap folder.

Apart from my tutorials, I would refer everyone to refer Jeremy Blum's Book Titled [Exploring Arduino: Techniques in Engineering Wizardry](https://www.amazon.in/Exploring-Arduino-Techniques-Engineering-Wizardry/dp/1118549368#:~:text=Learn%20to%20easily%20build%20gadgets,%2C%20and%20human%2Dcomputer%20interaction.)

A neat and well defined solution for the book's assignents have been provided in this directory itself. A link to the tinkerCad wiring diagram for each of these sketches have also been provided with each sketch.
