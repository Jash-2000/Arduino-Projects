# SF-3 Assignment

This assignment was meant as a practice assignment. The description is as folows:

```
Create an intruder alarm with a photoresistor, as many LEDs as you like, one buzzer, and a button. 
The board must behave as follows:
  1. When the photoresistor sees light, the LED(s) flash, and the buzzer produces a custom sound (any song you want)
  2. When the button is pushed, the board resets, Lights and buzzer turn off and the alarm becomes active again.
  3. When there is no light, LED(s) and the buzzer are off.
  4. Repeat!
```
