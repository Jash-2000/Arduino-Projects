If my tutorial helped you with your work, please do not forget to star my repository. For any further doubts, open an issue or directly drop me a mail at [jashshah0801@gmail.com](mailto:jashshah0801@gmail.com).

I have also made the H-bridge motor driver for L293D, which can be directly used for your projects. It is available over [here](https://github.com/Jash-2000/L293D-Library-Arduino).
